		<h1>Thoughts on the Fourth Graceling Realm Book: Winterkeep</h1>

		<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 15, 2025</p>

		<p>Reading <em>Winterkeep</em> was a mixed experience for me. While I was excited to return to the Graceling Realm, I found myself a little disappointed by how the setting shifted. The first three books had a strong medieval fantasy vibe, but <em>Winterkeep</em> introduced a world that felt much more modern and steampunk-inspired. It wasnâ€™t necessarily bad â€” just unexpected, and it made it harder for me to feel the same connection to the story at first.</p>

		<p>I also struggled with the beginning of the book. It felt slow, and I had a hard time getting invested in the characters' new problems and political tensions. In fact, I ended up DNF-ing it (did not finish) for a while because I simply lost interest. The pacing and tone didn't hook me the way <em>Graceling</em> or <em>Bitterblue</em> did.</p>

		<p>That being said, when I eventually came back to it and pushed through, the story picked up a lot toward the second half. Once the different character arcs started to come together â€” especially Lovisaâ€™s story â€” I found myself more engaged. The last third of the book was much more emotional and action-packed, and I was glad I gave it another chance.</p>
	
		<p>Overall, <em>Winterkeep</em> wasnâ€™t my favorite entry in the Graceling Realm series, but it still had powerful moments. I appreciated seeing familiar characters again, and even though the shift in tone threw me off, Kristin Cashoreâ€™s worldbuilding and emotional depth were still strong by the end. ðŸ’œ</p>
